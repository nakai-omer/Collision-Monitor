### Building a Simple Simulated Robot with Collision Avoidance in ROS 2

#### Objective:
Set up a ROS 2 environment, create a simple simulated robot in Gazebo with a LiDAR sensor, and develop a node for collision avoidance, with a strong focus on code quality and adherence to standards.

#### Tools:
- ROS 2
- Gazebo for simulation
- LiDAR sensor plugin

#### Tasks:
1. **ROS 2 Setup**: Install and configure ROS 2 on your system.
2. **Robot Creation in Gazebo**: Design a basic mobile robot model in Gazebo.
3. **LiDAR Integration**: Attach and configure a LiDAR sensor to the robot.
4. **Node Development for Collision Avoidance**: Develop a ROS node in C++ or Python to process LiDAR data and control the robot.
5. **Collision Detection Logic**: Implement logic to detect potential collisions and stop the robot accordingly.
6. **Testing and Debugging**: Test the robot in the Gazebo environment to ensure reliable collision avoidance.
7. **Documentation**: Document the setup process, simulation instructions, and provide a detailed explanation of your code.

#### Emphasis on Code Quality and Standards:
- **Clean Code**: Write clear, understandable, and well-commented code.
- **Modular Design**: Structure your code into functions or classes for better readability and maintenance.
- **Consistent Coding Standards**: Follow ROS 2 best practices and guidelines for coding styles.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and data validation.
- **Version Control**: Use a version control system like Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
  
#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **ROS 2 Proficiency**: Ability to effectively use ROS 2 for robot simulation and control.
- **Sensor Integration and Data Processing**: Skills in integrating and processing data from the LiDAR sensor.
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to clean coding principles, modular design, and consistent coding standards.
- **Problem-Solving and Innovation**: Effectiveness in developing a reliable collision avoidance system and handling different scenarios creatively.
